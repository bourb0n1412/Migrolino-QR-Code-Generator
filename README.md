# Migrolino QR Code Generator

## Overview
The Migrolino QR Code Generator is a React application developed to generate QR codes in the style of the Migrolino app for loyalty cards. The inspiration for this project comes from the use of QR codes composed of words. In the Migrolino app, these codes often consist of a combination of product (e.g., sandwich), version (e.g., v2), and year (e.g., 2023). These elements are used in snake_case and randomly concatenated, sometimes without underscores separating them (e.g., 2023sandwiches_v2, 2023_sandwichesv2).

## Note
This React application has been developed exclusively for project purposes and should not be abused. Any attempt to obtain free items from Migrolino or other stores without making the necessary payments is strictly prohibited. Misusing this application for fraudulent activities is illegal and ethically unacceptable.

Please use this application responsibly and respect the laws and rights of others. The QR Code Generator was created with the aim of exploring and understanding the functionality of QR codes without pursuing illegal or fraudulent intentions.
