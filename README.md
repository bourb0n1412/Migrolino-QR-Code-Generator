# Migrolino QR Code Generator

## Overview
The Migrolino QR Code Generator is a React application designed to generate QR codes in the style of the Migrolino app for collective passes. The inspiration for this project comes from the use of QR codes consisting of words. In the Migrolino app, these codes often consist of a combination of product (e.g. sandwich), version (e.g. v2) and year (e.g. 2023). These elements are used in the snake_case and are randomly strung together, but sometimes not separated by underscores (e.g. 2023sandwiches_v2, 2023_sandwichesv2).

## Note
This React application has been developed for project purposes only and should not be abused. Any attempt to obtain free items from Migrolino or other stores without making the required payments is strictly prohibited. Misuse of this application for fraudulent activities is illegal and ethically unacceptable.

Please use this application responsibly and respect the laws and rights of others. The QR Code Generator was created with the aim of exploring and understanding how QR codes work, without any illegal or fraudulent intentions.
